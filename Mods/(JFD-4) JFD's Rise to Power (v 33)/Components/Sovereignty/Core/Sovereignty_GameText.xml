			<Text>[COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Sovereignty[ENDCOLOR] is one of the new gameplay elements added by Rise to Power. It is the measurement of your ability to govern your civilization. Sovereignty is needed to pass Political Reforms, although it is not expended in doing so; simply, you will need a minimum amount of Sovereignty before you can pass a Political Reform.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sovereignty is accumulated from a variety of sources, such as Wonders and Reforms, up to a max of 50% or 100%, depending upon your specific Reforms. In almost all cases, Sovereignty bonuses require that certain conditions be met in all cities, for instance, having a garrison in all cities. These, again, are dependent upon your specific Reforms.</Text>

This minimum Sovereignty is determined by the era in which the Reform is unlocked, as well by your Legislature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Political Reforms are grouped into sets of three alignments: Left, Centre, and Right.

In 717, Sargon ordered the construction of a new palace-city at the confluence of the Tigris and the Greater Zab rivers. The demands for timber and other materials and craftsmen, who came from as far as coastal Phoenicia, are documented in contemporary Assyrian letters. The debts of construction workers were nullified in order to attract a sufficient labour force. The land in the environs of the town was taken under cultivation, and olive groves were planted to increase Assyria's deficient oil-production. The great city was entirely built in the decade preceding 706 BCE, when the court moved to Dur-Sharrukin, although it was not completely finished yet. Sargon was killed during a battle in 705. After his unexpected death his son and successor Sennacherib abandoned the project, and relocated the capital with its administration to the city of Nineveh, 20 km south. The city was never completed and it was finally abandoned a century later when the Assyrian empire fell.</Text>

The supposed burial site of the apostle Peter in 64 AD, some years later a shrine was constructed there. Replacing the shrine, construction of "old" St. Peter's was begun by the Emperor Constantine between 319 and 333 AD. Having fallen into serious disrepair over the centuries, Pope Julius II in 1505 determined to demolish the old church and replace it with a monumental structure, a construction project that spanned the next 120 years under a succession of popes and architects. To finance the colossal project, a number of popes authorized the wholesale selling of indulgences, a practice that led in part to Martin Luther's protestant movement. With work by some of the Renaissance's leading figures - Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante, Bernini and others - the church now stands as one of the great treasures of Western civilization.</Text>
