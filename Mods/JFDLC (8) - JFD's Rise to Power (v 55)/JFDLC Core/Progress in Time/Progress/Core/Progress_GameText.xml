			<Text>A a cinema is a building that contains an auditorium for viewing films (also called movies or cinemas), for entertainment. Most, but not all, theaters are commercial operations catering to the general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. Some movie theaters, however, are operated by non-profit organizations or societies which charge members a membership fee to view films. The film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue, sounds and music are played through a number of wall-mounted speakers. Since the 1970s, subwoofers have been used for low-pitched sounds. In the 2010s, most movie theaters are equipped for digital cinema projection, removing the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel.</Text>

Various coastal communities have long histories of subsistence whaling and harvesting beached whales. Industrial whaling emerged with organized fleets in the 17th century; competitive national whaling industries in the 18th and 19th centuries; and the introduction of factory ships along with the concept of whale harvesting in the first half of the 20th century. By the late 1930s, more than 50,000 whales were killed annually In 1986, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in order to increase the whale stock.</Text>

			<Text>Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e.g., lead) into "noble metals" (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.</Text>

The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it. Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid-like) plans.[6] The ancient Romans, inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities. City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience. The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning. As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared.</Text>

Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as film, photography, video production/editing, design, sequential art, conceptual art, and printmaking.

			<Text>In its most general sense, hunting is the pursuit of a target. For ancient societies, before the widespread domestication of animals and the creation of "livestock", hunting was vital to survival in the hunter-gatherer way of life. Hunting provided an important source of protein to augment the foraged plants and vegetables that made up the majority of the hunter-gatherer's diet. Hunting also provided significant exercise and challenges to these advancing people that improved communication and teamwork skills. Not only did hunting provide diet potential, but it also served as a way for early man to protect itself from cold weather through the use of furs and animal hides from the fallen beasts. The amount of energy that early humans put into hunting forced them to constantly discover new and creative ways to use every part of the animal.</Text>

It is often seen as the contrarian counterpart of Conservatism, though this is not necessarily accurate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a political movement, Liberalism was employed by revolutionaries in England, America, and France to counter the rise of absolutism and the divine right of kings which emerged out of the Renaissance. It spread quickly throughout Europe following the French Revolution in the 18th century, and those monarchies which did not adapt to it in the form of enlightened absolutism were transformed near homogenously into constitutional monarchs or republics subservient to the people.</Text>

			<Text>Naval architecture, also known as naval engineering, is an engineering discipline dealing with the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures. Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.</Text>

			<Text>Each early civilization had its own forms of recreation. Recreation – in the form of games and sports – were often the vestiges of warfare, hunting, religious practices or other useless activities. Plato among others held that recreation was crucial for both the individual as well as the society, in that one could learn, explore and experience things in a “safe” environment. But in the Middle Ages, for many, recreation became a luxury; everyone worked hard … and the Church condemned most forms of leisure (not that folk didn’t engage in all these despite this). The Renaissance wasn’t much better, although the wealthy did find time to play games and read, and “artistic hobbies” were taken up by various feckless folk.</Text>

			<Text>One of the oldest and most widespread social institutions is the exchange of goods, or Trade. At the most basic level of Trade, two people exchange items with each other. Ideally, the items given are in surplus and the items received are desired. The result is that both are better off, having exchanged extras for something wanted. People, as well as nations, normally have a comparative advantage over others in the production of some good or service. Through Trade, this advantage benefits both parties. Trade has also proven very important in the exchange of ideas.</Text>

This early type of galley was also known as a bireme and consisted of two decks of oars. They were first created by the seafaring Phoenecians of the Mediterranean in early antiquity. Later on, these ships evolved and a third row of oars was added by the addition of an outrigger to the hull, a projecting construction that allowed for more room for the projecting oars.

			<Text>Archer-bearing cavalry is a concept that dates to the earliest days of mankind, with its origins in the Neo-Assyrian empire. These first mounted archers involved two men and two horses – one man controlling both horses and the other man using the bow. Later examples developed by the Parthians and Scythians, and famously the Mongols and proto-Turks, involved only one man and one horse. These early horse archers were heavy cavalry, with thick armor and heavy bows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The invention of the crossbow changed this, as the archer-cavalryman no longer needed both hands to work a bow, and thus could use one hand to control the horse and another to shoot the crossbow. The German and Scandinavian armies used these soldiers extensively throughout the medieval era. They would act as scouts and skirmishers, as well as a flank-guard for knights and could repel attacks from enemy light cavalry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When fully engaged in battle, the crossbow was used much less extensively. In an initial charge towards the enemy, the cavalrymen would shoot their bolt at point-black range. However, instead of reloading, they would continue to fight using swords while on horseback. Certain mounted crossbowmen were equipped with weak crossbows in order to reload easily during the heat of battle. Inventions like the goat’s foot level and the cranequin allowed the mounted crossbowmen to reload and fire heavy crossbows as well as the weak ones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Despite initial success, mounted archery was generally ineffective against massed foot archers. A lone archer was a much smaller target than a man and a horse, and standard crossbowmen could usually outshoot their mounted counterparts. The mounted crossbowman became completely obsolete by the 16th century, as firearm technology had matured to the point where cavalrymen could be armed with rifles rather than crossbows.</Text>

			<Text>The Pistolier is a soldier armed with a pistol. What, were you expecting something else?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The first hand-cannons were used in early 13th Century China and entered Europe and Arabia a century later. The brutal efficacy of the hand-cannon made the innovation very popular in armies, quickly changing the face of warfare. Armies without firearms were completely outmatched by those with them, no matter how primitive.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The specific origins in the pistol lies in the Hussite wars in the 1420s. The Czech píšťala was a type of handcannon used extensively through the fighting, and was a key factor in the Hussite victory at the end of the war. These hand cannons later became the handheld pistol in the 15th century, and by the 1800s a revolver had been developed and was famously used by Clint Eastwood to shoot Lee Van Cleef. These revolvers were the first truly practical hand firearms, succeeding the single-shot navy handguns of the age of flintlock weaponry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Development on the firearm would continue throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, being used increasingly in combination with the rifle. Following Hiram Maxim’s gun in 1883, several gunsmiths attempted to apply the principle on a handheld scale. The first of the semi-automatic pistols were developed in the 1890s, and served as the standard sidearm during the first world war. To this day, the pistol is the standard side-arm for almost all armies and the primary weapon for most police forces in the world.</Text>

Simply a pouch between two lengths of cord, the sling was used to swing a projectile – a stone, lump of lead, or anything else convenient – in an arc until such time as it was launched. Although a thrown stone doesn’t have the lethality of an arrow or bullet, it can still do a lot of damage. If nothing else, a rain of well-aimed stones gives an enemy pause before rushing in. And, until composite bows were invented, it had a considerable range advantage over bows and spears. In addition, wasn’t hard to find ammunition. With the exception of Australia, ancient slings have been found in archaeological digs all over the world. Even a barbarian can sling a rock.

Quiet, and without a tell-tale cloud of gunpowder smoke, the windbuchse did not work after rough treatment, something that was inevitable in battle.

It is the oldest known religious building on earth, dating to approximately 10000 BCE, during the Neolithic age of Human civilization, and predating all major civilizations and cities by several millenia. It was first observed during the 1960's, when archeologists noted that the hill could not be natural due to the shape, yet dismissed it as a Byzantine burial ground. It was not thought different until 1994, and not excavated until a year later. The complex is similar in manner to Stonehenge, with a round shape and large Monolithic stones. However, unlike Stonehenge, many of the pillars are carved with the figures of several animals, which are believed to have been sacred to the hunter-gatherers which constructed Göbekli Tepe.</Text>

			<Text>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the architect Lal Chand Ustad designed the structure from the crown of the Hindu god Krishna. The design of the 953 windows, known as 'jharokhas', is also compared to that of the honeycomb of the beehive. The original idea for the latticework on the windows is to allow the royal ladies to view the streets below without themselves being seen, observing strict 'purdah', face coverage. Sawai Pratap Singh's grandfather, Sawai Jai Singh founded Jaipur in 1727. Sawai Pratap Singh comissioned the Hawa Mahal as an expansion of the Royal City Palace, and Pratap Singh was a devoted adherent to Khrishna, this contributed to the design of the building as the Mukuta, Khrishna's headgear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though no actual historical evidence is available, it is believed that the women of the royal family, having to observe purdah, were given the opportunity to witness the transactions of the markets and royal processions behind the stone carved screens. Hawa Mahal was also used by the royal family as a retreat from the hot weather of Jaipur, the unusually designed windows provided a cool breeze and ventilation. The five story Hawa Mahal rises 50 feet from the base with the top three floors having the dimention of just one room, the bottom two floors have patios at the back of the structure. The shape of the front facade of the building is designed from semi-octagonal bays, producing its unique face, whereas the back side of the building retains need-based chambers with pillars and corridors reaching to the top floor. Inside the Hawa Mahal is described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels; while fountains adorn the center of the courtyard".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lal Chand Ustad also planned the founding of Jaipur, considered at the time as one of the best-planned cities in India. The red and pink sandstone of the Hawa Mahal reflects the other monuments and the epithet of Jaipur as the "Pink City". It is also a reflection of the fusion of Rajput and Mughal architecture; the use of the Rajput style using domed canopies and fluted pillars, and the Mughal style of stone inlay filigrees and arches.</Text>

			<Text>Hollywood is a district of Los Angeles, USA, famous for it's film industry. The area started life as a idealistic 'suburban America', however it quickly grew from 1909, when film-makers started to arrive, and is now synonomous with the American Film Industry. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Today, Hollywood is glamourised for being the land of the rich and famous, where dreams are made and wishes come true. It is home to several iconic buildings, including the Hollywood Bowl and Grauman's Chinese Theatre. However, when most people think of Hollywood, they think of the large sign atop the Hollywood hills. This sign started life as a billboard for the suburban settlement, then named "Hollywoodland". In 1949, the "Land" was removed as part of a renovation contract.</Text>

Although best known for his art, da Vinci was also an accomplished observer and designer. Preserved in his sketchbooks are ideas for dozens of inventions, many of them centuries ahead of their time. These include designs for such devices as drawbridges, construction equipment, parachutes, and even helicopters. His scientific and technical drawings became the basis for the development of many of these modern devices.</Text>

			<Text>The Kandariya Mahaadeva Temple is the largest and most decorated medieval temple found in the Khajuraho Group of Monuments in India. It is one of the best examples of preserved temples from India's medieval era. One of India's most popular tourist attractions today, Khajuraho was the religious capital of the Chandela Rajputs. The temple was built by King Vidyadhara, arguably one of the greatest of the Chandela kings, at about 1050.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main spire - the shikhara - rises 31 meters and forms the shape of Mount Kailash, the residence of lord Shiva; of whom the temple worships, and is surrounded by 84 smaller spires. The temple features columned halls, an entrance porch and the inner sanctum. 646 statues decorate the sides of the temple and at the top of the shikhara is the amalaka; a circular ring motif commonly found in the architecture of temples in northern India. Also, 226 figures are found lining parts of the temple's wall, but some of these are of a sexual nature and are not publicly displayed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The name of the site means 'the Cave of Mahadeva', Mahadeva being another name for Shiva. The temple represents the pinnacle of traditional medieval nouth Indian temple architecture. At first glance the temple appears to be formed from a single piece of solid stone, when this is not the case.</Text>

It was constructed in 1967 to commemorate the fallen Soviet soldiers that took place in the Battle of Stalingrad during World War 2. At the time of construction, it was declared as the tallest statue in the world, at 91 metres to the tip of the sword. Despite the larger statues, the nature of the posture of the statue required significantly more engineering techniques, with the large 33-metre sword rising well above the main body. Pressed concrete and wire ropes were used to achieve the shape.
