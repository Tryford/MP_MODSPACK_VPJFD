			<Text>Cedar is the common name given to several similar but unrelated genera and species of evergreen trees found worldwide, each with a variety of uses which have made the trees highly prized and sought after. However, it historically has referred to just a single genus, Cedrus, native to the Mediterranean and western Himalayas. One species in particular, Cedrus libani (known commonly as the Lebanon Cedar) has been extensively used for a variety of practical and spiritual purposes since the time of the Babylonians, while their significance dates back to the earliest known civilization, having been designated as the dwelling of the gods in the Epic of Gilgamesh. The Phoenicians and Egyptians used the wood for shipbuilding, while the wood was burnt as part of Jewish celebrations of the New Year and the bark played a significant role in Hebrew cleansing ceremonies after a period of leprosy. The myriad uses of Cedar wood have not been without a toll on the population of the tree, and over the centuries the extensive use of it has resulted in the Cedar population of the Mediterranean has declined drastically. Conservation attempts have been made since the time of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, and continue to be made to this day.</Text>

They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates, and indeed a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty. They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant Aves from other living groups. Feathers have also been noticed in those Theropoda which have been termed feathered dinosaurs. Although feathers cover most parts of the body of birds, they arise only from certain well-defined tracts on the skin. They aid in flight, thermal insulation, waterproofing and coloration that helps in communication and protection.</Text>

For example, it is said to represent things such as sexual purity and detachment, according to Asian tradition; thus, it has a place in religion and general culture. Many Indian deities are portrayed with a lotus plant; for example, Lakshmi, Hindu goddess of love and wealth among other things, is often portrayed with a lotus to show her detachment, given the traditional representation. Lotus stamens can also be used to make green tea, which expands into Vietnamese culture as well. The fibers extracted from lotuses can also be used to make clothing, but this is only put into practice at one place: Inle Lake, in Burma, where the cloth produced is used to make special portraits of the Buddha, called “kya thingahn”, or “lotus robes” in English. Overall, the lotus has great significance within both Asian culture and religion.</Text>

The leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds. Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.

Obsidian has been used even before neolithic times for tools and the like; knives dating back to 700,000 BC have obsidian parts to them. By around 5000 BC, obsidian mining was present, and tools were being produced from them on a large scale. Obsidian’s sharpness made it very useful as a tool, but also as a weapon, given its sharp edges would take little sharpening for a lot of damage dealt. The substance was also used in places such as Rapa Nui for the famous Moai statues, again showing its wide application of uses. Obsidian also had a lot of trade value due to it only being found around volcanic areas. The use of obsidian declined as more refined materials, such as iron and bronze, were used for the same purpose.</Text>

Widespread since the dawn of civilisation, opium was used by the ancient Egyptians, Romans, Greeks and Assyrians as a painkiller, the best available one at the time. In modern medicine, opium in the form of morphine is still used for the same purpose, albeit less frequently. By the 15th century, opium became a popular recreational drug in China, though at this state it was yet to get onto the mainstream market. However, as some officials were unhappy with the use of drugs, opium began to become outlawed in China, which had a knock-on effect to the rest of the world that continued the opium trade; China was one of the main suppliers. In 1799, opium was completely banned in China, and the ban remained enforced until 1860. During this time, the British Empire became more interested in establishing a monopoly on the opium trade, managing to hold one in India after establishing control over the main opium reserves in the region. The United States were also keen to get a share, leading to a lot of market competition. As China had outlawed opium, one of the main markets for the trade was gone, forcing Britain to enter the Opium Wars, in which the British Empire soundly defeated the Qing Dynasty, and they managed to lift the opium ban in China as well as gaining Hong Kong.</Text>

			<Text>In its native Central America and South America, rubber has been collected for a long time. The Mesoamerican civilizations used rubber mostly from Castilla elastica. The Ancient Mesoamericans had a ball game using rubber balls, and a few Pre-Columbian rubber balls have been found (always in sites that were flooded under fresh water), the earliest dating to about 1600 BC. According to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the Spanish Conquistadores were so astounded by the vigorous bouncing of the rubber balls of the Aztecs that they wondered if the balls were enchanted by evil spirits. The Maya also made a type of temporary rubber shoe by dipping their feet into a latex mixture. Rubber was used in various other contexts, such as strips to hold stone and metal tools to wooden handles, and padding for the tool handles. While the ancient Mesoamericans did not have vulcanization, they developed organic methods of processing the rubber with similar results, mixing the raw latex with various saps and juices of other vines, particularly Ipomoea alba, a species of Morning glory. In Brazil the natives understood the use of rubber to make water-resistant cloth. A story says that the first European to return to Portugal from Brazil with samples of such water-repellent rubberized cloth so shocked people that he was brought to court on the charge of witchcraft.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When samples of rubber first arrived in England, it was observed by Joseph Priestley, in 1770, that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing out pencil marks on paper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The para rubber tree initially grew in South America, where it was the main source of what limited amount of latex rubber was consumed during much of the 19th century. About 100 years ago, the Congo Free State in Africa was a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. The Congo Free State was forged and ruled as a personal colony by the Belgian King Leopold II where millions of Africans died as a result of lust for rubber and rubber profits. After repeated efforts rubber was successfully cultivated in Southeast Asia, where it is now widely grown.</Text>

			<Text>Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur (Latin sulphur) was known in ancient times and is referred to in the Torah (Genesis). English translations of the Bible commonly referred to burning sulfur as "brimstone", giving rise to the name of 'fire-and-brimstone' sermons, in which listeners are reminded of the fate of eternal damnation that await the unbelieving and unrepentant. It is from this part of the Bible that Hell is implied to "smell of sulfur" (likely due to its association with volcanic activity). By the 3rd century, the Chinese discovered that sulfur could be extracted from pyrite. Chinese Daoists were interested in sulfur's flammability and its reactivity with certain metals, yet its earliest practical uses were found in traditional Chinese medicine. A Song Dynasty military treatise of 1044 AD described different formulas for Chinese black powder, which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (KNO3), charcoal, and sulfur.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Early alchemists gave sulfur its own alchemical symbol which was a triangle at the top of a cross. In traditional medical skin treatment which predates modern era of scientific medicine, elemental sulfur has been used mainly as part of creams to alleviate various conditions such as scabies, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema and acne. The mechanism of action is not known, although elemental sulfur does oxidize slowly to sulfurous acid, which in turn (through the action of sulfite) acts as a mild reducing and antibacterial agent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier helped convince the scientific community that sulfur was an element, not a compound. With the sulfur from Sicily being principally controlled by the French market, a debate ensued about the amount of sulfur France and Britain got. This led to a bloodless confrontation between the two sides in 1840. In 1867, sulfur was discovered in underground deposits in Louisiana and Texas. The highly successful Frasch process was developed to extract this resource. With the advent of the contact process, the majority of sulfur today is used to make sulfuric acid for a wide range of uses, particularly fertilizer.</Text>

Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican peoples cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid, called tlilxochitl by the Aztecs, and Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortez is credited with introducing both vanilla and chocolate to Europe in the 1520s.[NEWLINE][TAB]The Totonac people, who inhabit the Mazatlan Valley on the Gulf Coast of Mexico in the present-day state of Veracruz, were the first to cultivate vanilla. According to Totonac mythology, the tropical orchid was born when Princess Xanat, forbidden by her father from marrying a mortal, fled to the forest with her lover. The lovers were captured and beheaded. Where their blood touched the ground, the vine of the tropical orchid grew. In the 15th century, Aztecs invading from the central highlands of Mexico conquered the Totonacs, and soon developed a taste for the vanilla pods. They named the fruit tlilxochitl, or "black flower", after the matured fruit, which shrivels and turns black shortly after it is picked. Subjugated by the Aztecs, the Totonacs paid tribute by sending vanilla fruit to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan.</Text>

			<Text>The Belém Tower sits at the mouth of the Tagus River, just outside the city of Lisbon. The idea of the tower came from João II, though he died before planning or building could start. His successor, Manuel I, instead designed and built the tower. Unusually, it was built on a small island as a sort of sea fort, intended to be a defence mechanism for Lisbon’s potentially vulnerable coast. However, there is a popular belief that the tower was initially built inland, but shifted out to sea by the Great Lisbon Earthquake. The building was completed in 1519, and over the coming years, it was improved and strengthened to be more effective against potential attacks. However, the Belém Tower is perhaps best known for its role in the Portuguese Renaissance - or, more specifically, an icon of the colonisation of the New World. As an island fortress, just outside the shipbuilding hub of Portugal, the Belém Tower would have been the last sight that ships going on their maiden voyage would have seen. In later years, the tower also took up the role of a customs house that ships were required to pay tax to, and the main navigation lookout of Lisbon. Over the years, it also served as a military garrison, given its capabilities as a coastal garrison. Today, the Belém Tower is a popular tourist destination, as not only does it have a long history, but architecture considered to be among the best examples of the Manueline style, a late gothic Portuguese building form. </Text>
