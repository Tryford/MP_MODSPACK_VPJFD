			<Text>[COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Disloyalty[ENDCOLOR], the opposite to [COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Loyalty[ENDCOLOR], increases based upon the city's distance from the Capital (for Colonies), occupied status (for conquered Cities), and a variety of other factors. You can counteract this Disloyalty with Loyalty produced from buildings such as the Barracks, or from various Policies and Wonders. A city connection, military garrison, and spy will also increase a city's Loyalty.</Text>

			<Text>Nationalism is the belief that the affairs of the nation are the primary concern of its citizens. A recent political phenomenon (the first major application taking place after the French Revolution), it has nonetheless become the overriding paradigm for modern world politics. It is important to know that nationalism can come in a variety of forms, some permutations bearing little resemblance to each other. Many early nationalistic leaders preached the superiority of their country over all others. While this type isn't extinct today (as evidenced by the ethnocentric nationalism in the former Yugoslavia), most promote national determinism. Sanctioned by the United Nations, this is the belief that each nation should be responsible for its own growth and independence.</Text>

			<Text>Trafalgar Square is a public area located in the heart of the City of Westminster, in London, England. Redevelopment of the existing area, known as Charing Cross, began in 1820 under the guide of architect John Nash, who in turn was commisioned by King George IV, and was completed in 1845. The name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, a naval battle fought between England and Napoleonic France during the Napoleonic Wars. In the center of the square is Nelson's column, a monument dedicate to Admiral Horatio Nelson, who died at the battle which was the square's namesake. The column features four cast iron plates made from captured French guns, each depicting a famous battle in the Napoleonic Wars. The base of the column is guarded by four Lion statues. </Text>
