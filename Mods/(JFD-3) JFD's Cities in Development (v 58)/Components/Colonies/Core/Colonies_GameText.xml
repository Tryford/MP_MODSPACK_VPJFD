The most successful of these corporations were the "Honourable" East India Company of Britain (chartered by Queen Elizabeth in 1600 AD), the Dutch East Indies Company (1602) and the French Company of the Indies (1664).</Text>

			<Text>Studying throughout history, one can witness how colonists, a type of setter, very often occupied land previously home to long-established peoples, designated as indigenous (also called "natives", "Aborigines" or, in the Americas, "Indians"). In some cases (such as Australia), as colonialist mentalities and laws change, the legal ownership of some lands is contested by indigenous people, who either claim or seek restoration of traditional usage, land rights, native title and related forms of legal ownership or partial control. The word "settler" was not originally usually used in relation to unfree labour immigrants, such as slaves (e.g. in the United States), indentured labourers (such as in Colonial America), or convicts (such as in British America, c. 1615–1775; Australia 1788-1868). More recently descendants of these immigrants may argue that they have as much right to use the word "settler" as the descendants of free immigrants. In the figurative usage, a "person who goes first or does something first" also applies to the American English use of "pioneer" to refer to a settler—a person who has migrated to a less occupied area and established permanent residence there, often to colonize the area; as first recorded in English in 1605. In United States history it refers to those people who helped to settle new lands. In this usage, pioneers are usually among the first to an area, whereas settlers can arrive after first settlement and join others in the process of human settlement.[citation needed] This correlates with the work of military pioneers who were tasked with construction of camps before the main body of troops would arrive at the designated camp site.</Text>

			<Text>Pena National Palace is a large romanticist palace located on a hill in the municipality of Sintra, Portugal. The hill was formerly the site of a monastery, which was constructed following a rumoured appiration of the Virgin Mary. This monastery was destroyed in the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. Remaining untouched for many years, it was in 1838 that, after being purchased by King consort Ferdinand II, the grounds of the original monastery were rebuilt into a palace for the Portuguese royal family to stay at during the summer. The building of this new palace was placed under command of a notable German architect and engineer, Baron Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege, and construction was completed in 1854. It remained in possession of the Portuguese royal family until the Republican Revolution of 1910, after which it was turned into a national monument as well as a museum. Finally, in 1995 the palace was turned into a world heritage site by UNESCO.</Text>
